Hi I'm Dave Malhin. I'm a BS Information Technology graduated last 2017 at Central Mindanao University which located in Bukidnon. I'm into anime and manga person. I love to watch anime and obviously love reading anime manga. Before I love to play games like dota, ML and etc but now I love to watch news about outer space, politics etc. My goal for this year is to relax more cause I'm stress with my current job, we have one life to live so we must enjoy it. The reason why I want to be Web Developer? I don't know how to answer this cause I'm already a Web Developer, I think I would say is to enhance my current skills and also invest to myself. It's very hard to find an another job with my current skills so that why I enroll in this platform and also have a connection to the future with the refocus.
